HEALTH ALERTS AND APPLICATION FOR A REGION

PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
                                          Create a webpage that can be used by individuals as well as various medical clinic authorities in each region to report viral and mosquito borne cases registered per day. The webpage interface can be as simple as type of viral infection reported or optionally collect all the symptoms reported. Location data can be obtained from webpage and data can be sent to main channel. Using channel, we can analyse the data reported and create reports that can be sent to regional municipal authorities for necessary actions or posted to the webpage where users can view health alerts for their area.
USES OF WEBPAGE: Webpage like this can help in collecting the health information in a region and provide this to NGO’S and government authorities to take necessary steps. For example an action may be taken to sanitize an area if necessary or send a team of doctors for a camp in the area that reported large number of cases.
